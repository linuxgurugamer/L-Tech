        #LOC_LTech_2 = This cave is very interesting.
        #LOC_LTech_3 = What an amazing discovery!
        #LOC_LTech_4 = This beast used to terrorise our rockets.
        #LOC_LTech_5 = We should send a device to take tissue samples from this deceased lifeform.
        #LOC_LTech_6 = It can't be, is that a face?
        #LOC_LTech_7 = I wonder if this formed naturally or somebody carved it.
        #LOC_LTech_8 = Interesting, somebody else beat us here.
        #LOC_LTech_9 = Shh! I think it's looking back at us.
        #LOC_LTech_10 = Is the rest of it underground?
        #LOC_LTech_11 = We should investigate this further!
        #LOC_LTech_12 = I wonder what's under all the dirt.
        #LOC_LTech_13 = Shouldn't we take pictures of the unknown?
        #LOC_LTech_14 = This picture of the space center is a good test of our camera. But shouldn't we take pictures of more interesting things?
        #LOC_LTech_15 = AHH! Oh wait it's just the space center.
        #LOC_LTech_16 = Why are we taking a picture of this?
        #LOC_LTech_17 = What a great place to land an aircraft.
        #LOC_LTech_18 = I wonder where this came from?
        #LOC_LTech_19 = I'm not saying it were humans, but it were humans!
        #LOC_LTech_20 = Eventually we should check out the propulsion system on that.
        #LOC_LTech_21 = Think it has cup holders?
        #LOC_LTech_22 = Where are the boosters?!?! Maybe that's why it crashed.
        #LOC_LTech_23 = This must be important!
        #LOC_LTech_24 = It's a picture of a rock arch... Interesting.
        #LOC_LTech_25 = Such arch would be a great way to test our spacecraft, if only it wasn't so hard to get to.
        #LOC_LTech_26 = One wonders if the arch formed naturally, or if something put that hole there.
        #LOC_LTech_27 = What a good place to put a base.
        #LOC_LTech_28 = This picture is amazing!

        #LOC_LTech_39 = You received today's weather broadcast.
        #LOC_LTech_40 = Various channels are filled with music.
        #LOC_LTech_41 = Picked up a heavily encrypted broadcast, lets not talk about this.
        #LOC_LTech_42 = A second space center tracking signal is picked up.
        #LOC_LTech_43 = Somebody forgot to turn on the sensor during this test.
        #LOC_LTech_44 = Local radio waves contain a slight pattern. Fascinating!
        #LOC_LTech_45 = The receiver is going haywire. May need retuning.
        #LOC_LTech_46 = Sensors indicate there is a weak radio transmission nearby.
        #LOC_LTech_47 = There is a unusually large amount of static picked up.
        #LOC_LTech_48 = Large amount of static is rendering the receiver useless, except for the fact that there is a large amount of static
        #LOC_LTech_49 = Static fills the airwaves, emanating from the planet below
        #LOC_LTech_50 = Received short and powerful bursts, sounds like a flag in the wind.
        #LOC_LTech_51 = Picked up long bursts, the sound is reminiscent of waves crashing on the seashore near KSC.
        #LOC_LTech_52 = The sensor is giving odd readings here.
        #LOC_LTech_53 = Received radio waves appear to be scrambled and twisted up.
        #LOC_LTech_54 = The counter returns a simple radiation reading.
        #LOC_LTech_55 = The meter goes off the chart as it's bathed in solar radiation!
        #LOC_LTech_56 = The extreme heat and radiation from the star overwhelm the meter.
        #LOC_LTech_57 = the sensor detects a decent amount of radiation emanating from the sun.
        #LOC_LTech_58 = It seems the surface is bathed in solar radiation at this range.
        #LOC_LTech_59 = It's hard to tell if there's any radiation coming from the planet- the background solar radiation at this range makes readings difficult.
        #LOC_LTech_60 = Surprisingly, it seems Eve's dense atmosphere somehow manages to shield the planet from even more radiation than Kerbin's. There's very low levels here.
        #LOC_LTech_61 = Aside from the regular solar radiation, there's nothing unusual to report.
        #LOC_LTech_62 = The surface of this tiny asteroid displays no radioactive properties.
        #LOC_LTech_63 = Solar radiation seems to be the only radiation here.
        #LOC_LTech_64 = Down here with a full atmosphere and magnetosphere the sensor only picks up background radiation... and the odd tiny spike.
        #LOC_LTech_65 = Down here with a full atmosphere and magnetosphere the sensor only picks up background radiation.
        #LOC_LTech_66 = The sensor detects the faintest hint of stronger-than-background radiation.
        #LOC_LTech_67 = The sensor barely even picks up background radiation here.
        #LOC_LTech_68 = Outside of Kerbin's atmosphere and magnetosphere, the sensor detects strong solar radiation.
        #LOC_LTech_69 = Just inside Kerbin's Magnetosphere, the sensor begins to detect radiation from an external source.
        #LOC_LTech_70 = Nothing more than expected background radiation can be detected here.
        #LOC_LTech_71 = The ground here shows nothing more than regular background radiation.
        #LOC_LTech_72 = The terrain has almost no radioactive signature here.
        #LOC_LTech_73 = The ground here shows nothing more than regular background radiation, with a few tiny examples. Scientists back home would be interested in this.
        #LOC_LTech_74 = The terrain here shows nothing more than regular background radiation.
        #LOC_LTech_75 = The terrain inside the impact crater has a very faint radioactive signature. Possibly whatever caused the impact had radioactive elements.
        #LOC_LTech_76 = The area has a slightly higher radioactive signature than was expected.
        #LOC_LTech_77 = The sensor detects normal solar radiation, nothing more.
        #LOC_LTech_78 = It seems the surface contains almost no radioactive materials.

        #LOC_LTech_84 = There are large pockets of radiation coming from further inside the planet
        #LOC_LTech_85 = No radiation can be detected from outside the atmosphere, while ther are large amounts of radiation coming from the planet
        #LOC_LTech_86 = The planet seems to be reflecting the solar radiation, and possibly generating radiation of its own. Curious.
        #LOC_LTech_87 = The surface is remarkably protected from radiation - there's virtually nothing to detect.
        #LOC_LTech_88 = The water shows no signs of radiation.
        #LOC_LTech_89 = Aside from the solar radiation, there is little to report.
        #LOC_LTech_90 = There's a slight radioactive signature somewhere on this planet that interferes with the sample.
        #LOC_LTech_91 = There's a strange hint of radiation coming from the planet.
        #LOC_LTech_92 = The surface contains very little in the way of radioactivity.
        #LOC_LTech_93 = Aside from background radiation, there's nothing unusual to report here.

        #LOC_LTech_97 = This could have very practical applications back on Kerbin.
        #LOC_LTech_98 = Bowls don't hold snacks very well, while in micro-gravity.
        #LOC_LTech_99 = You keep remembering the effect of micro-gravity on a stomach full of snacks.
        #LOC_LTech_100 = Perhaps attempting to play billiards in space was not the wisest "research".
        #LOC_LTech_101 = You discover a new appreciation for gravity while sneezing.
        #LOC_LTech_102 = You really need to find a better way to water sample plants in low gravity. At least you don't need a shower anymore!
        #LOC_LTech_103 = The model rocket spun out of control and ended up inside the snacksbox.
        #LOC_LTech_104 = After ignition the model rocket exploded. Maybe we should use more boosters?
        #LOC_LTech_105 = The model rocket was successful, nothing else to note.
        #LOC_LTech_106 = The model rocket flew exceptionally high!
        #LOC_LTech_107 = To sustain Kerbal life here, we will need habitation structures and suits.
        #LOC_LTech_108 = It is inhospitable for Kerbal life here.
        #LOC_LTech_109 = The fire combustion was successful. What would happen if we add more oxidizer?
        #LOC_LTech_110 = Fire! Help! ... Oh, that's supposed to happen.
        #LOC_LTech_111 = The plant roots grow away from the light, irregradless of the gravity
        #LOC_LTech_112 = The plants are growing toward the light
        #LOC_LTech_113 = Study the effect of microgravity on plants
